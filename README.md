# Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. An ultrasonic sensor is used to determine the distance of an object in cm and is displayed on a 4-digit 7-segment display. An RGB is illuminated in response to the distance measurement by the ultrasonic sensor. RED shows if the distance is measured less than 10 cm (close), YELLOW if distance is measured between 10 and 20 cm (moderate), and green if it is measured greater than 20 cm (far). Pushing up on the joystick will increase this threshold, while pushing down on the joystick will decrease the threshold. For example, putting the joystick up once will make close = moderate, moderate = far, far = far. Joystick down will have far = moderate, moderate = close, and close = close. Pressing and holding the joystick will change the display to be measured in inches instead of cm. Releasing the press will automatically display cm again.
